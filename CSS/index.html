          HTML websites on their own are bland and boring. Using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), is a language used by web developers to make websites visually appealing.<br><br>
          The ruleset which makes up CSS is explained and shown below.
          <ul class="no-style">
            <li class="no-style"><strong>Selector</strong> - The beginning of the ruleset which is used to target the element that will be styled</li>
            <li class="no-style"><strong>Declaration Block</strong> - The code in between the curly braces that contains the declaration</li>
            <li class="no-style"><strong>Declaration</strong> - The group name for the property and value pair that applies a style to the selected element</li>
            <li class="no-style"><strong>Property</strong> - The first part of the declaration that signifies what visual characteristic of the element is to be modified</li>
            <li class="no-style"><strong>Value</strong> - The second part of the declaration that signifies the value of the property</li>
          </ul>

          CSS Rulesets can also be applied directly in a HTML document.<br>
          <code>&lt;p style="color: red, font-size: 20px"&gt; Hello, world! &lt;/p&gt;</code><br>
          The line of code above will make that specific paragraph element have red text, which is 20 pixels in size. Using an external CSS sheet or <code>style</code> element can only apply styles to multiple of the same tag.

          Internal Stylesheet
        </div>
        <div class="reference-section-body">
          As discussed above, HTML has the <code>&lt;style&gt; &lt;/style&gt;</code> element which allows for CSS to be created and applied directly in the HTML document. These tags are used within the <code>&lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt;</code> tags, like so:

          External Stylesheet
        </div>
        <div class="reference-section-body">
          It's best to store CSS in an external stylesheet to avoid mixing HTML and CSS together. <code>.css</code> is the file format for external stylesheets.<br>
          To link an external stylesheet, it can be done with the following HTML:
          <img src="../images/css_externalStylesheet.jpg" alt="Code snippet showing how to apply the style tags in a HTML document.">
          Like the anchor element, <code>link</code> uses the <code>href</code> attribute which points to where the CSS file is. The <code>rel</code> attribute describes the relationship between the HTML and CSS file.
          As a stylesheet is being used, the value <code>rel="stylesheet"</code> needs to be used. 
        </div>

          Selectors - Type
        </div>
        <div class="reference-section-body">
          Declarations are a fundamental part of CSS as they apply the style to a selected element. The <em>selector</em> is used to target specific HTML tags, then the declaration applies the style.
          <img src="../images/css_selectorsType.jpg" alt="Code snippet showing a CSS ruleset using a specific type selector.">
          The snippet above will apply the colour red to all <code>p</code> elements.

          Selectors - Universal
        </div>
        <div class="reference-section-body">
          The universal selector in CSS applied the declarator to all HTML elements. The universal selector is the asterisk *.
          <img src="../images/css_selectorsUniversal.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing a CSS rule using the universal selector.">
          The above rule will apply to all HTML elements, meaning that each element will have the Verdana font as well as a black border which is 2 pixels thick.  
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="reference-section">
        <div class="reference-section-title">
          Selectors - Classes
        </div>
        <div class="reference-section-body">
          In HTML, there is a <code>class</code> attribute. Creating a class in CSS is done by putting a period before the selector.
          <img src="../images/css_classes.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing how a CSS class is used within a HTML element.">
          Using <code>.c-heading</code> in any HTML <code>class</code> attribute will apply the chosen CSS class.<br><br>
            Multiple classes can be added to the <code>class</code> attribute to create unique styles.
        </div>

      <div class="reference-section">
        <div class="reference-section-title">
          Selectors - ID
        </div>
        <div class="reference-section-body">
          At times, single elements may need to be selected. This can be done in HTML by using the <code>id=""</code> attribute. In CSS, to select the ID, the hash (#) is used in the selector.
          <img src="../images/css_id.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing how a CSS ID is used within a HTML element.">
          Best practise is to use IDs when only a specific ruleset needs to be applied to an element and not used on multiple elements. Whilst IDs can be used on multiple elements, it's best to use classes for this instead. 
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="reference-section">
        <div class="reference-section-title">
          Selectors - Attribute
        </div>
        <div class="reference-section-body">
          CSS has an <em>attribute selector</em> which allows specific HTML attributes to be selected. This can be done by wrapping the selector in square brackets [ ].
          <img src="../images/css_attributeSelector.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing how the attribute selector is used in CSS">
          The above example will only apply the style to any HTML tags that have the <code>href</code> attribute applied.<br><br>
          Types and/or attribute values can also be specified too.
          <img src="../images/css_attributeSelector2.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing how the attribute selector can be used to target specific text.">
          The above example will target the <code>img</code> tag and match the text within the <code>src</code> attribute. In this example, the images will be sized based on their rule.

        <div class="reference-section-title">
          Pseudo-Class
        </div>
        <div class="reference-section-body">
          Elements on a webpage can change depending on user behaviour. For example, hovering over text may change it's appearance. A good example is when a user hovers over a link on a website and the background image may change to a darker or lighter colour.
          Pseudo-classes are applied to rulesets by adding a colon (:) after the selector and adding the name, which are:
          <ul class="no-style">
            <li class="no-style"><code>:hover</code> -> Changes the behaviour when a user hovers their mouse over the element</li>
            <li class="no-style"><code>:visited</code> -> Changes the behaviour when a user has visited a link</li>
            <li class="no-style"><code>:disabled</code> -> Will disable the input or user interactbility on a certain field/button/text box</li>
            <li class="no-style"><code>:active</code> -> Changes the behaviour of the chosen element when the user has activated it (I.E; by clicking and holding)</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="reference-section-title">
          Specificity
        </div>
        <div class="reference-section-body">
          Specificity is the order by which the browser decides which CSS styles will be displayed. The best practice in CSS is to style elements while using the lowest degree of specificity to that if an element needs a new style, it's easily overridden.
          IDs are the most specific selector in CSS, followed by class, then type. Consider the following HTML and CSS below
          <img src="../images/css_specificity.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing specificity in CSS">
          The colour of the text in the example above will be set to blue. This is because the class selector is more specific then the type selector.
          If an ID attribute had been set and set to orange, the text would change to orange as the ID if more specific than the class.<br><br>
          To make styles easy to edit, it's best to use the type selector (element name), if possible. If not, use a class selector. If that's not specific enough, use the ID.

        <div class="reference-section-title">
          Chaining
        </div>
        <div class="reference-section-body">
          When writing CSS rules, it's possible to require an HTML element to have two or more CSS selectors at the same time. This is achieved by combining multiple selectors which is called <em>chaining</em>. 
          For example, if there was a special class for <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> elements, the CSS would look like
          <img src="../images/css_chaining.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing chaining in CSS">
          This means that only <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> elements with the class <code>special</code> would have the style applied. If a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element had the attribute class set to special, the style would not be applied.
        </div>

        <div class="reference-section-title">
          Descendant Combinator
        </div>
        <div class="reference-section-body">
          In addition to chaining selectors to select elements, CSS supports selecting elements that are nested within other HTML elements, known as descendants.
          Considering the following:
          <img src="../images/css_descendantsCombinator.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing how to use the CSS Descendant combinator.">
          The nested <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements are descendants of the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element and can be selected with the <em>descendant combinator.</em>

          Multiple Selectors
        </div>
        <div class="reference-section-body">
          To make CSS more concise, it's possible to add CSS styles to multiple CSS selectors at once. This avoid writing repetitive code. 
          The following code has repetitive style attributes
          <img src="../images/css_multipleSelectorsRepetitive.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing repetitive code in CSS.">
          To avoid writing <code>font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;</code> twice, they can be separated by using a comma to apply the same style to both.

          The above CSS rule will change all <code>h1</code> elements to the font specified.<br>

          The property can be set to one of the following:
          <ul class="no-style">

        <div class="reference-section-body">
          The best way to remember what the foreground and background colour affects, if the foreground would affect the text in a container, whilst the background will colour the elements background which doesn't affect the text.
          <img src="../images/css_visualRules_foreground_background.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing the background colour and colour properties in CSS">
          The ruleset above will make all the text grey and the background black.<br><br>
          Opacity is the measurement of how transparent something is. CSS has the <code>opacity:</code> property which controls this. This property can only contain values between 0 and 1. 1 means 100% opacity, 0 means 0% opacity, and 0.5 means 50% opacity. 1 is visible, 0 is invisible.

          The ruleset above will put 10 pixels of padding between the content of the paragraph and the border on all 4 sides. This property is often used to expand the background colour and make the content look less cramped.
          Each side of the padding can be specified using the following properties:
          <ul class="no-style">
            <li class="no-style"><code>padding-top</code></li>
            <li class="no-style"><code>padding-right</code></li>
            <li class="no-style"><code>padding-bottom</code></li>
            <li class="no-style"><code>padding-left</code></li>
          </ul>  
          Each property affects the padding on only one side of the box's content, giving more flexibility in customization.<br><br>

          Padding Shorthand
        </div>
        <div class="reference-section-body">
          Defining the left, right, bottom, and top of padding can be in the padding property. A declaration that uses multiple properties as values is known as <em>shorthand property</em>.
          These can be specified in various ways:

          <b>With 4 values:</b>
          <img src="../images/css_boxModel_paddingFourVaules.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing the padding property with 4 values">
          In the above, the four values correspond to the amount of padding on each side in a <b>clockwise direction</b>. In order, it specifies them like so:
          <ul class="no-style">
            <li class="no-style"><code>padding-top = 6px</code></li>
            <li class="no-style"><code>padding-right = 11px</code></li>
            <li class="no-style"><code>padding-bottom = 4px</code></li>
            <li class="no-style"><code>padding-left = 9px</code></li>
          </ul>
          <b>With 3 values:</b>
          <img src="../images/css_boxModel_paddingThreeValues.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing the padding property with 3 values">
          If the left and right side of the content can be equal, the padding shorthand property allows for 3 values to be specified. This method specifies them like so:
          <ul class="no-style">
            <li class="no-style"><code>padding-top = 5px</code></li>
            <li class="no-style"><code>padding-left</code> and <code>padding-right = 10px</code></li>
            <li class="no-style"><code>padding-bottom = 20px</code></li>
          </ul>
          <b>With 2 values:</b>
          <img src="../images/css_boxModel_paddingTwoValues.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing the padding property with 2 values">
          If the top and bottom, left and right can be equal, 2 values can be specified. This method specifies them like so:
          <ul class="no-style">
            <li class="no-style"><code>padding-top</code> and <code>padding-bottom = 5px</code></li>
            <li class="no-style"><code>padding-left</code> and <code>padding-right = 50px</code></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

        <div class="reference-section-title">
          Margin
        </div>
        <div class="reference-section-body">
          The margin refers to the space directly outside of the box. The <code>margin</code> property is used to specify the size of this space.
          <img src="../images/css_boxModel_marginProperty.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing the margin property">
          The ruleset above will place 20 pixels of space on the outside of the paragraphs box on all four sides. This means that another HTML element cannot come within 20 pixels of the paragraphs border.
          The same with padding, the <code>margin</code> property has different names too. They can be applied like the padding with shorthand properties following the same order.
          <ul class="no-style">
            <li class="no-style"><code>margin-top</code></li>
            <li class="no-style"><code>margin-right</code></li>
            <li class="no-style"><code>margin-bottom</code></li>
            <li class="no-style"><code>margin-left</code></li>

          The <code>auto</code> value
        </div>
        <div class="reference-section-body">
          The <code>margin</code> property allows content to be centred. However, there are a few syntax requirements. 
          <img src="../images/css_boxModel_marginAuto.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing the auto value used along side the margin property">
          The ruleset above will centre the divs in their containing elements. The 0 sets the top and bottom margins to 0 pixels. The <code>auto</code> value instructs the browser to adjust the left and right margins until the element is centred within its containing element.<br><br>
          To centre an element, the width <b>must be set</b> for that element. Otherwise, the width of the div will automatically be set to the full width of its containing element, like the <code>body</code> for example.
          It's not possible to centre an element that takes up the full width of the page since the width of the page can change due to display and/or browser window size.<br><br>
          The ruleset above sets the width to 400 pixels which is less than the width of most displays. This will centre the div within its containing element that is greater than 400 pixels wide.

          Margin Collapse
        </div>
        <div class="reference-section-body">
          With margins, there is a term called <em>margin collapse</em>. Horizontal margins (left and right), like padding, are always displayed and added together. For example, if two divs are next to each other, they will be as far apart as the sum of their adjacent margins.
          <img src="../images/css_boxModel_marginCollapse.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing the CSS properties margin-right and margin-left.">
          The rulesets above will place each div next to each other with a 40 pixel gap between them.<br><br>
          Unlike horizontal margins, vertical margins do not add. Instead, the larger of the two vertical margins sets the difference between adjacent elements.
          <img src="../images/css_boxModel_marginVerticalCollapse.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing the CSS properties margin-top and margin-bottom which will result in a margin collapse.">
          The vertical margin between <code>#div-one</code> and <code>#div-two</code> elements is 40 pixels. Although the sum is 60 pixels, the margin collapses so the spacing is only dependant on <code>#div-two</code> top margin.

          Minimum and Maximum Height and Width
        </div>
        <div class="reference-section-body">
          Because web pages can be viewed through different screen sizes, the content on the web page can suffer from those changes in size. To avoid this problem, CSS offers two properties that can limit how narrow or how wide an elements box can be. The same applies to the height too.
          <ul class="no-style">
            <li class="no-style"><code>min-width</code> -> Sets the minimum width of an elements box</li>
            <li class="no-style"><code>max-width</code> -> Sets the maximum width of an elements box</li>
            <li class="no-style"><code>min-height</code> -> Sets the minimum height of an elements box</li>
            <li class="no-style"><code>max-height</code> -> Sets the maximum height of an elements box</li>
          </ul>
          If these properties are set too low to contain the content within the element, the content may be difficult to see. This is discussed next.
        </div>

      <div class="reference-section">
        <div class="reference-section-title">
          Overflow
        </div>
        <div class="reference-section-body">
          All of the components of the box model comprise an elements size. For example, an image that has the following dimensions is 364 pixels wide and 244 pixels tall.
          <ul class="no-style">
            <li class="no-style">300 pixels wide</li>
            <li class="no-style">200 pixels tall</li>
            <li class="no-style">10 pixels padding on the left and right</li>
            <li class="no-style">10 pixels padding on the top and bottom</li>
            <li class="no-style">2 pixels border on the left and right</li>
            <li class="no-style">2 pixels border on the top and bottom</li>
            <li class="no-style">20 pixels margin on the left and right</li>
            <li class="no-style">10 pixels margin on the top and bottom</li>
          </ul>
          The total dimensions (364x244) are calculated by adding all of the vertical dimensions together and all of the horizontal dimensions together. Sometimes, these components result in an element that is larger than the parents containing area.
          How can it be ensured that we can view all of an element that is larger than its parent's containing area?<br>
          The <code>overflow</code> property controls what happens to content that overflows outside of its box. These are the commonly used values.
          <ul class="no-style">
            <li class="no-style"><code>hidden</code> -> Any content that overflows will be hidden from view</li>
            <li class="no-style"><code>scroll</code> -> A scrollbar will be added to the elements box so that the rest of the content can be viewed by scrolling</li>
            <li class="no-style"><code>visible</code> -> The overflowed content will be displayed outside of the containing element. This is the default value.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

          Resetting Defaults
        </div>
        <div class="reference-section-body">
          All major web browsers have a default stylesheet they use in absence of an external stylesheet. These default stylesheets are known as <em>user agent stylesheets.</em> In this case, the term user agent is a technical term for browsers.<br><br>
          User agent stylesheets often have default CSS rules that set default values for padding and margin. This affects how the browser displays HTML element, which can make it difficult for a developer to design or style a web page. Many developers choose to set these default values so that they can work with a clean slate.
          <img src="../images/css_boxModel_resettingDefaults.jpg" alt="A screenshot of a CSS ruleset using the asterisk selector to set defaults to a web page">
          The ruleset above resets the margin and padding of all HTML elements. It is often the first CSS rule in an external stylesheet. As both of the properties are set to 0, no unit of measurement is required.
        </div>

          Visibility
        </div>
        <div class="reference-section-body">
          Elements on a HTML page can be hidden from view with the <code>visibility</code> property. The <code>visibility</code> property can be set to one of the following values:
          <ul class="no-style">
            <li class="no-style"><code>hidden</code> -> Hides the element</li>
            <li class="no-style"><code>visible</code> -> Displays an element</li>
            <li class="no-style"><code>collapse</code> -> Collapses an element</li>
          </ul>  
          <img src="../images/css_boxModel_visibility.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing a CSS ruleset making use of the visibility property">
          The example above will hide the 'Donate' option from the web page. However, this only hides the option when viewing the web page. Looking at the pages source will still show the option. 
          Further more, the web page will only hide the contents of the element and will still leave an empty space where the element is intended to be.<br><br>
